# pySTAN
Toolset of dynamical model STructure ANalysis algorithms

## Remark

Previously, the work was presented at scientific conferences as pySTAN. However, due to the already existing pystan-package focusing on Bayesian computation and the potential risk for confusion, the package is now active as the pystran package.
